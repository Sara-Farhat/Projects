Is this re-admission ? 31397 mentioned twice in hospital type code c and twice in b.\n### as a healthcare professional I know that the patient is given same MRN regardless of number of encounters. It is alarming because the LOS ASSOCIATED with that patientid is very high 41-50 days. Maybe there are duplicated rows? rows 3 and 4 seem duplicated. Let me drop one of them.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_new.drop(train_new.index[4])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-22T21:18:01.003253Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-22T21:18:01.003614Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-22T21:18:01.061075Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-22T21:18:01.003584Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-22T21:18:01.060274Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":30,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### The questions we need to answer to predict patients at risk of high LOS:\n### - What department has the greater density of patients with highest LOS?\n### - Can bed grade affect LOS?
